## Overview and Origin

Webull Corporation is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in New York.The company was founded on May 27, 2017, by Wang Anquan, a former employee of Alibaba Group. The current known CEO is Anthony Denier, who, in his own right, carries an extensive history and career in impacting the financial industry through massive technological innovation. According to Anthony Denier, Webull was built on the premise "to provide ALL investors with the best data, analytics, and trading products to make our clients smarter traders and investors."The Webull company maintains its funding through "order flow payments, short seller fees, subscriptions, interest paid on margin, account management fees, and interest on free credit balances." In addition, Webull has a solid foundational investor-funded capital reaching over 200 million in evaluation. This corporation ultimately, as stated in this article, "Webull is funded primarily by deals for order flow. Each time a user places an order on their investing platform, it goes to a designated market maker (DMM). In turn, this DMM rewards Webull for sending its trades to it." Turning it into one of the fastest-growing companies in the financial industry.





## Business Activities

## Results


Webull has continued to be a driver of innovation, continually improving its user interface, ultimately making it easier to use, quicker and cheaper with transactional data, versatile with different asset classes to use, and a government-backed protection plan against stolen or lost funds. With continual updates and feature adjustments, Webull will continue to thrive and majorly impact how families take care of their wealth from their fingertips. The leading indicators for success within these companies come down to Brand awareness, gained new users, app downloads, signups, and account top-ups. According to a study by Forbes "The top traffic source to webull.com is direct traffic, driving 80.21% of desktop visits last month, and search is the 2nd with 14.72% of traffic. The most underutilized channel is ads. "
Overall, Webull is a leader in user signup, retention, and accessibility. Many individuals across the globe have enabled the application to be a standard practice in daily routines. However, the only downside is there are no mutual funds, Cash management, and fragile education support.


## Recommendations

In the case of personally advising Webull, I would include a Cash management account and mutual fund and improve education. On top of making necessary updates and continually improving the user interface, I would mainly focus on this. 

Improvements:

Cash Management: Webull currently doesn't offer any cash management accounts, ultimately not allowing individuals to gain interest on uninvested cash.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are all for the safe and easy allocation of capital within a safe set of parameters. Mutual funds would appeal to and enable families to diversify their portfolios.

Educational support: When a platform lacks a solid academic format, how can it expect its users to have a fun and intuitive experience? Setting forth a plan to improve educational output would encourage many more users to be brought to the platform naturally.

When a company competes in a competitive market, continually improving and innovating is the best way to stay on top of competitors. Including these additions to the Webull platform would allow for the expansion and growth of the company exponentially.
Lastly, the platform's most positive and impactful implications will require continual investment in overall software and application. From Robo advisors to a lending protocol for funds, all necessary improvements will be made through technological innovation.
